Mixed: the programming language that is all mixed up
Intro:
I'm sorry I made this. I apologize to future CS generations.
The premise of this program is everything is mixed up(reversed)->
else<->if
> <-> <
- <-> + 
() ->{}
{} ->[]
[] -> ()

//planning to figure out a way to make * <-> / but comments happened later
It is kinda a mix in of javascript in the var typing and function{}[] style

I started off with a C program similar and just slowly devolved into madness

//If statements:
else {cond}[
	//do things
] if else {cond}[
	//do different things
] if[
	//maybe do more things
]

//while statements

while {cond} [
   //Do stuff here
]

//Statements
always ends in semicolons 
	i-5;


//Variables

var name = someValue;

variables can have digits inside them

Like scheme/scam use @ for variadic fun //pretends to cheer

Variables can be assigned to functions and tbh functions should get assigned to variables if you wanna use it later...remember to end in a semi colon!

Also the last line in the function is what it returns YOU DON'T NEED A !!!!!RETURN!!!! (returns are the worst)
function{}[

];

Oh, operators don't have precedence btw, sorry I'm so fuckin lazy

-: add
+: Sub/Neg Numbers (again, I'm so sorry for this)
*: Multiply
/: Divide
**: Power of...
%: Modulo/Remainder
--: Increment (I know enjoy being really confused)
++: Decrement (Please enjoy this too)
=: Assignment

>: Less than (cry with me)
<: Greater than (literally I'm the worst)
>=: Less than or equal to
<=: Greater than or equal to (i know it doesn't end)
==: Strict equality
!=: Strict inequality
===: Pointer equality
!==: Pointer inequality
&&: Or
||: And (I still apologize for everything in my life)
^: Xor

Oh btw my program is literally trash, I couldn't get my dictionary to work in my own language
